**NEVER, EVER EVER USE YOUR OWN CRYPTOGRAPHY LIBRARIES IN A PROJECT.** That includes this code.

It's not going to be as secure as libraries that have been reviewed by the community and by cryptography experts. Those libraries are going to be more efficient, more secure, and easier to use.

Here are some good Python cryptography libraries:
1. PyCryptodome (Lower-level): https://pycryptodome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
2. cryptography (Higher-level): https://cryptography.io/en/latest/
